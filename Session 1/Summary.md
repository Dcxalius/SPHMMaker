# Session 1 Summary
Use this log to follow Session 1 at a glance.  
Reading: scan `Actions Completed` for chronological notes and `Next Steps` for pending work.  
Writing: append new bullets under the appropriate section, keeping the most recent items at the bottom so the narrative stays linear.

## Actions Completed
- Reviewed `docs/datapack/UnitData.json` (Sheep and Walker entries, each with `MaxHealth` 100.0).
- Created working branch `Session-1` (initial attempt with space rejected by Git, then retried with hyphen).
- Removed outdated `docs/datapack/UnitData.json` to avoid duplication with `npcdata` and `mobdata`.

## Next Steps
- Document any further changes or investigations here as they occur.
